<h2>Website content</h2>
    <p>
        My personal website will have three main pages scrolling vertically. At the top of the website will be the Navbar. The Navbar will have the title on the far left, along with my content pages, and the "contact me" all available as buttons to the right on top of the Navbar. The Navbar will stay at the top of the screen while scrolling throughout the website. At the top of the website, under the Navbar will be a horizontal filler image possibly with my name and a small bio. At the bottom of the website will contain my "contact me" section. Visitors will provide requested information and info will be directly emailed to me. Next to the questionnaire will be links to my related social media account to that visitors can click and be sent to related platform.
    </p>
<h2>Desktop View</h2>

<h2>Desktop View Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pages one, two, and possibly three will look and work similarly to each other. The page will be split in half between two main boxes. One
        box will contain a horizontal heading picture or border and directly under will be content talking either my hobbies, interest, and skills.
        <strong>(Example frame 4)</strong>Directly opposite will be a picture related to the content next to it. <strong>(Example frame 5)</strong> While scrolling down the page the boxes will swap places.<strong>(Example frame 4 - frame 8)</strong>

<h2>Mobile View Description</h2>
    <p>
        While in mobile view, images will now alternate virtically, but now can only view one box at a time. Navbar will still be visible at the top the screen. Title will still be on far left. On far right pages one, two, and three will now be a burger with drop down menu for pages.At the bottom of the website will still be the "contact me" form with all available links.
