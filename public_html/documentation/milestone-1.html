<h1>Andrew Germain's PWP</h1>

<p>I want my PWP to be my personal landing page. This page will give someone the chance to see what
a website would look like with me in full control, while also allowing them to see a handful of my personal interest
and hobbies. I'll occasionally post on the few social media account I have ,but I've never been too big on any social
media platforms. This landing page could serve as my single social media page for potential
employers, fellow collaborators and anyone else who's interested to see if who I am. My end goal with my PWP is to be
a time capsule of my first personal project. One day I'll have a portfolio of all my project from now until futures
        present, and I can see how along.</p>
