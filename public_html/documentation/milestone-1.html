<h1>Andrew Germain's PWP</h1>

<p>
    <strong>Purpose:</strong>
    This page will give someone the chance to see what a website would look like with me in full control, while also
    allowing them to see a handful of my personal interest and hobbies.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Audience:</strong>
    This landing page could serve as my
    single page for potential employers, fellow collaborators and anyone else who's interested to see who I am.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Goal:</strong>
    My end goal with my PWP is to be a time capsule of my first personal project. One day I'll have a portfolio of all
    my project from now until futures present, and I can see how along.

        <strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Hannah Bakersfield was the star baker in her hometown. Hannah is getting
    to the age where retirement is more in the conversation than before. Hannah wants to start her own online bakery

    <p>
        <strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Hannah has been using social media and cash app to promote and complete
    transactions with her bakery. The online bakery is just too much to keep up with using previous methods. Hannah wants
    to be able to find a starting junior developer to build her website because they are typically more affordable than
    an experienced coder. </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Goals:</strong> Hannah wants to be able to find someone to build her website by looking at a project or
    two, of whoever is interested. Ms. Bakersfield is short on cash and is wanting to find a junior web developer to build
    their skills and her company together. </p>

        <strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, I want to be able to find out about the person I want to build my website
    and see a website done by them in action. </p>
